# [Nodify-Shopify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodify-shopify)

Node connector for the Shopify API. Talk to Shopify API speaking node!

Use Nodify-Shopify to grab all Shopify API resources. 
It also handles authentication (using [the new OAuth2 API](http://www.shopify.com/technology/5922341-sound-the-trumpets-oauth2-has-arrived?ref=microapps)) and billing.	

## Usage:

	var nodify = require('nodify-shopify');
	session = nodify.createSession(shopName, apiKey, secret, persistentOauth2Token);
	session.order.all({limit: 5}, function(err, orders){
		if(err) { console.log(orders); throw err;}
		console.log(orders);
	});

You also have a Demo app to get the ball rolling, called [Nodify-App](https://github.com/microapps/Nodify-App).
Check that out to get a better understanding of how this module works, notably in case you want to dynamically
retrieve the OAuth2 token, or check the tests.
